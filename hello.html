<h1>Trying to convince your parents to get a fluffy pet? Well a ginea pig is your answer! Here we will help you convince your parents to get you a guniea pig...</h1>

<p>Having a pet is a great step towards being responsible, and a small fluffy pet is the way to go! Ginea pigs are quiet and easy to feed, and they don't require too much attention either, and the bonus is, they're so cute and adorable.
